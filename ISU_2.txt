The author of the book Hominids talks about the difference between the Neanderthal world and our current world. The author causes the reader to think which version of Earth is better.  This topic is developing through Dr. Ponter Boddit while he is talking to Dr. Marry Vaughn  and Marry has conflicting views on whether she likes the Barast(Neanderthal) world or not. This is quite interesting to see as Marry starts to get the impression that the Barast version of the earth is better than the current world she lives in. When she is given a glimpse of the Barast world she is stunned with amazement. In those conversations Ponter tells her about the Companions which are a robot that every Barast must wear from birth and it records every single action anyone does.  As a result of the Companions recordings there is no crime committed in the Barast world, if there is a crime committed they get caught immediately as the authorities can look at the recordings to see who is guilty. Marry being a victim of a sexual assault a few days prior to meeting Ponter Loves the idea immediately. When marry is told that there is no religion in the Barast world she dislikes the idea as she was a devout catholic growing up. This creates a internal conflict. She finally comes to the conclusion that Ponter's world is better when she hears that the woolly mammoth and the passenger pigeons are not extinct in his world and there is no Internal combustion engine as they found that method of transport crude and harmful to the environment and themselves. This was something us humans refused to acknowledge until the turn of the millennia
